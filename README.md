# Giphy API Thingy

## What
This is a simple web application that uses AJAX to query the GIPHY API endpoint, and displays them to the page.

You can search by topic by clicking on the included buttons, or add your own by typing the topic of choice into the "Add a new Button" bar and clicking the "Add" button!

You can also save gifs by clicking the save icon on the bottom right corner. To view saved gifs, click on the "Saved" button! To removed saved gifs, click on the trash icon on the bottom right corner of the saved gif!

If you would like 10 more gifs of a given topic, simply press the button another time!

Click the "Info" button on the page at anytime to see these instructions again!

## Why
This project was used to hone the skills of making AJAX calls to API endpoints, and utilizing the data in a meaningful way, via the use of jQuery for dynamic page and DOM manipulation, AJAX to make calls to a third-party API, Bootstrap 4 and Animate.CSS as some CSS frameworks, modals, toasts and much more!
