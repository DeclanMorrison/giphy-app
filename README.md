# Giphy API Thingy

## What
This is a simple web application that uses AJAX to query the GIPHY API endpoint, and displays them to the page.

## Why
This project was used to hone the skills of making AJAX calls to API endpoints, and utilizing the data in a meaningful way, via the use of jQuery for dynamic page and DOM manipulation, AJAX to make calls to a third-party API, Bootstrap 4 and Animate.CSS as some CSS frameworks, modals, toasts and much more!
